# Academic Portfolio Website

This is a simple academic portfolio website built with HTML and CSS, designed to showcase academic achievements, research projects, and publications.

## Pages

- **Myself**: Personal introduction and background
- **Work & Study**: Educational background and academic journey
- **Projects**: Current research projects and interests
- **Publications and Conferences**: List of conference presentations and academic contributions

## GitHub Pages Setup

To host this website on GitHub Pages:
