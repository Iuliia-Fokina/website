            <div class="content">
                <p>I am a doctorate student at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, doing theoretical and experimental research on text reading.</p>
                
                <p>My main areas of interest are text reading and memory recall across different reading perspectives, I explore how perspective-taking influences information retention. I am also interested in the forward testing effect, investigating how prior testing enhances future learning and recall.</p>
                
                <p>Beyond research, I have a deep appreciation for oenology, and reading. I watch TV shows, and enjoy going out with my friends. I love traveling, hiking, and camping, always seeking new experiences and adventures. At home, I enjoy the company of my cat, Milo.</p>
