                    <h2>Perspective Effects on Reading and Memory</h2>
                    <p>This study examines how reading perspective shapes text processing and memory recall. When readers adopt a specific perspective, they focus more on relevant details, leading to better recall of that information while largely ignoring perspective-irrelevant details. Whether a shift in perspective during recall can enhance memory for previously overlooked details remains debated.</p>
                    <p>To explore this, we present participants with six short texts and introduce a perspective shift before an additional recall stage. This design allows us to assess how readers encode, recall, and reread information when their perspective changes. By investigating how seemingly irrelevant details are processed, this study aims to clarify the role of reading perspective in memory formation and retrieval.</p>

                    <h2>Forward Testing Effect and Effortful Reading</h2>
                    <p>This study investigates how the Forward Testing Effect (FTE) enhances learning by prompting strategy optimization during retrieval. Specifically, we examine how free recall testing—compared to no prior testing—affects the learning of a multi-section STEM text. Additionally, we explore the various reading strategies individuals adopt, aiming to understand how effortful reading influences retention and comprehension in sequential learning tasks.</p>
